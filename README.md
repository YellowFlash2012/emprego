# emprego
React app to keep tab on Job applications
![emprego](/public/images/emprego.png)

# Scope:
Job application tracking made easy. Create an account, login and start saving info regarding your job applications and classify them by status: pending, interview or rejected.

# Tech stack:
front-end: React + Redux ToolKit
backend: external node/express API

# Highlights:
- use of recharts library to display barchart and area chart of job status: pending, rejected or interview
- nested routes with react-router
- dynamically switching betwen login or signup ui without leaving the current page
- using the same form for both adding new job and editing an existing one.
- 

# key learning points:
- use of rtk in a production level app.
- pagination with rtk without using any library
- I think rtk is better than contextAPI. Will focus on that going forward.
